# task-logger
Log your activities and time spent to find patterns in your daily routines.

## Why does this exist? 
Google Sheets and Excel are too clunky for continuous logging; this project aims to automate that pipeline.

## What does this do?
- Provides scripts to make logging less painful.
- Stores activities in a clean PostgreSQL schema with constraints.
- Enables querying for insights into focus, routines, and productivity, and schedules.
- Provides setup guide for Metabase integration.

## How do I use this? 
**Work in Progress**
- See '/scripts'
- Schema is in schema.sql
- Run cli.py and the `help` command if needed.

## Roadmap
### Data Analysis
- SQL/Python scripts to find patterns in your schedule
- Prebuilt SQL queries to generate reports/key metrics
- Metabase Integration
